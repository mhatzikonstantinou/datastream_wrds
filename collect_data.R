Dealscan - LPC Connector Feed data

Translation tables between the legacy Dealscan and the new Dealscan
For users who need translation between the IDs in the legacy database and the IDs in the new database 
(facility id to tranche id, package id to deal id, LPC company id to LoanConnector company id), 
the linking tables are available on wrds-cloud: lpc_loanconnector_company_id_map, wrds_loanconnector_ids


The new Dealscan database is available
Dealscan recently changed its database structure and stopped supporting the previous version of the database. Users can still access the last version (Legacy files), but we recommend using the new Dealscan for up-to-date data.

  Note:
  This WRDS Analytics Tool is built on the different data vintages from Refinitiv Dealscan and Worldscope data. The equity identifiers, 
such as cusip, isin, sedol and I/B/E/S tickers are linked to Dealscan borrowers through a fuzzy name-matching algorithm based on the company
identities primarily form Worldscope and verified by research assistants. An earlier version of this data has been used in following paper:
  
  Beyhaghi, et al. " International Lending: The Role of Lenderâ€™s Home Country" Journal of Money, Credit and Banking, Forthcoming.

To acknowledge the contributions of the manual verification tasks and unqiue algorithm, we would suggest users of this data cite above work. The data will be automatically updated based on the trained matching algorithm and verification procedure. WRDS will manually verify the content periodically. If you find any wrong matchings, please feel free to contact us.
